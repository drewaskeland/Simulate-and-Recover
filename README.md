This is a simulate and recover program for EZ diffusion with the purpose of identifying whether the EZ diffusion model can be used to estimate parameters from data generated by the EZ diffusion model. 

It includes a file “ez_diffusion.py” which:

- Computes theoretical forward statistics (R_pred, M_pred, V_pred) based on parameters (a, v, t) 

- Simulates summary statistics (R_obs, M_obs, V_obs) based on given parameters (a, v, t, N).

It includes a file “recovery.py” which uses observed summary statistics (R_obs, M_obs, V_obs) to estimate parameters (a, v, t) using optimization or fitting algorithms.

It includes a file “main.py” which:

- Performs a loop where it simulates summary statistics (R_obs, M_obs, V_obs) based on the true parameters (a_true, v_true, t_true) using the simulate_summary_stats function. It then attempts to recover these parameters using recover_parameters from “recovery.py.”

- Sets values for the true parameters and iterates over different sample sizes.

It includes a file “ez_diffusion_model.py” which enables the user to initialize with observed data, compute recovered parameters using the EZ diffusion model, manage updates to the observed data, as well as simply providing convenient access to these parameters. It is used to carry out a series of corruption tests in my test file.

It includes a file “test_file.py” which implements a series of tests designed to ensure the robustness of my simulate and recover program.

Finally it includes files “main.sh” and “test.sh” which contain bash script that can be used to run the tests and the main program.

Conclusion:

The program resulted in average biases near zero for the parameters as well as average squared error near zero for the parameter estimations, suggesting high accuracy in the parameter estimations. Sample size greatly impacted accuracy, with average bias and squared error decreasing exponentially as sample size increased from 10 to 40 to 4000. My model produced zero invalid iterations, suggesting that my model consistently produced meaningful and accurate estimates of the model parameters and successfully implemented the simulate and recover program to the EZ diffusion model.

This simulate-and-recover exercise demonstrates the model's excellent ability to recover parameters under various conditions, including noise and different sample sizes. It also validates the proposed claims of EZ diffusions ability to accurately estimate parameters from data generated by the EZ diffusion model.

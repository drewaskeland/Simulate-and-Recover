    """
    Recover EZ diffusion model parameters from observed summary statistics,
    using the expected forward functions:
        R_pred = 1/(1 + exp(-1.38629 * a * v))
        M_pred = t + (a / (2 * v)) * ((1 - exp(-1.38629 * a * v)) / (1 + exp(-1.38629 * a * v))) - 0.1

    The inversion is given by:
        a_est = (V_obs / 0.02)^(1/4)
        v_est = 1 / a_est      (since the model assumes a * v = 1)

    Parameters:
        R_obs (float): Observed accuracy rate.
        M_obs (float): Observed mean response time.
        V_obs (float): Observed variance of response times.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with keys "a", "v", and "t" corresponding to the 
              estimated boundary separation, drift rate, and nondecision time.
